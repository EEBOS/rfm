module Rfm
  
  # The Record object represents a single FileMaker record. You typically get them from ResultSet objects.
  # For example, you might use a Layout object to find some records:
  #
  #   results = myLayout.find({"First Name" => "Bill"})
  #
  # The +results+ variable in this example now contains a ResultSet object. ResultSets are really just arrays of
  # Record objects (with a little extra added in). So you can get a record object just like you would access any 
  # typical array element:
  #
  #   first_record = results[0]
  #
  # You can find out how many record were returned:
  #
  #   record_count = results.size
  #
  # And you can of course iterate:
  # 
  #   results.each (|record|
  #     // you can work with the record here
  #   )
  #
  # =Accessing Field Data
  #
  # You can access field data in the Record object in two ways. Typically, you simply treat Record like a hash
  # (because it _is_ a hash...I love OOP). Keys are field names:
  # 
  #   first = myRecord["First Name"]
  #   last = myRecord["Last Name"]
  #
  # If your field naming conventions mean that your field names are also valid Ruby symbol named (ie: they contain only
  # letters, numbers, and underscores) then you can treat them like attributes of the record. For example, if your fields
  # are called "first_name" and "last_name" you can do this:
  #
  #   first = myRecord.first_name
  #   last = myRecord.last_name
  #
  # Note: This shortcut will fail (in a rather mysterious way) if your field name happens to match any real attribute
  # name of a Record object. For instance, you may have a field called "server". If you try this:
  # 
  #   server_name = myRecord.server
  # 
  # you'll actually set +server_name+ to the Rfm::Server object this Record came from. This won't fail until you try
  # to treat it as a String somewhere else in your code. It is also possible a future version of Rfm will include
  # new attributes on the Record class which may clash with your field names. This will cause perfectly valid code
  # today to fail later when you upgrade. If you can't stomach this kind of insanity, stick with the hash-like
  # method of field access, which has none of these limitations. Also note that the +myRecord[]+ method is probably
  # somewhat faster since it doesn't go through +method_missing+.
  #
  # =Accessing Repeating Fields
  #
  # If you have a repeating field, RFM simply returns an array:
  #
  #   val1 = myRecord["Price"][0]
  #   val2 = myRecord["Price"][1]
  #
  # In the above example, the Price field is a repeating field. The code puts the first repetition in a variable called 
  # +val1+ and the second in a variable called +val2+.
  #
  # =Accessing Portals
  #
  # If the ResultSet includes portals (because the layout it comes from has portals on it) you can access them
  # using the Record::portals attribute. It is a hash with table occurrence names for keys, and arrays of Record
  # objects for values. In other words, you can do this:
  #
  #   myRecord.portals["Orders"].each {|record|
  #     puts record["Order Number"]
  #   }
  #
  # This code iterates through the rows of the _Orders_ portal.
  # 
  # =Field Types and Ruby Types
  #
  # RFM automatically converts data from FileMaker into a Ruby object with the most reasonable type possible. The 
  # type are mapped thusly:
  #
  # * *Text* fields are converted to Ruby String objects
  # 
  # * *Number* fields are converted to Ruby BigDecimal objects (the basic Ruby numeric types have
  #   much less precision and range than FileMaker number fields)
  #
  # * *Date* fields are converted to Ruby Date objects
  #
  # * *Time* fields are converted to Ruby DateTime objects (you can ignore the date component)
  #
  # * *Timestamp* fields are converted to Ruby DateTime objects
  #
  # * *Container* fields are converted to Ruby URI objects
  #
  # =Attributes
  #
  # In addition to +portals+, the Record object has these useful attributes:
  #
  # * *record_id* is FileMaker's internal identifier for this record (_not_ any ID field you might have
  #   in your table); you need a +record_id+ to edit or delete a record
  #
  # * *mod_id* is the modification identifier for the record; whenever a record is modified, its +mod_id+
  #   changes so you can tell if the Record object you're looking at is up-to-date as compared to another
  #   copy of the same record
  class Record < Rfm::CaseInsensitiveHash

    # Saves local changes to the Record object back to Filemaker. For example:

    #     record.save

    # This code finds every record with _Bill_ in the First Name field, then changes the first name to 
    # Steve.
    #
    # Note: This method is smart enough to not bother saving if nothing has changed. So there's no need
    # to optimize on your end. Just save, and if you've changed the record it will be saved. If not, no
    # server hit is incurred.

    # Like Record::save, except it fails (and raises an error) if the underlying record in FileMaker was

    #
    # When you do, the change is noted, but *the data is not updated in FileMaker*. You must call
    # Record::save or Record::save_if_not_modified to actually save the data.
